## Description
GASNet is a language-independent, networking middleware layer that provides network-independent, high-performance communication primitives including Remote Memory Access (RMA) and Active Messages (AM). It has been used to implement parallel programming models and libraries such as UPC, UPC++, Co-Array Fortran, Legion, Chapel, and many others. The interface is primarily intended as a compilation target and for use by runtime library writers (as opposed to end users), and the primary goals are high performance, interface portability, and expressiveness. ***NOTICE***: The GASNet library built by this Spack package is ONLY intended for unit-testing purposes, and is generally UNSUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE.

## Usage
### Pull (Download)
To download the latest version of gasnet run,

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/autamus/gasnet:latest
```

or to download a specific version of gasnet run,

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/autamus/gasnet:2021.3.0
```
### Run
To run the container as an application run,
```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/autamus/gasnet gasnet --version
```

or to run the container in an interactive session run,
```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/autamus/gasnet bash
```

### Mounting volumes between the container and your machine
To access files from your machine within the gasnet container you'll have to mount them using the `-v external/path:internal/path` option.

For example,
```bash
docker run -v ~/Documents/Data:/Data ghcr.io/autamus/gasnet gasnet /Data/myData.csv
```
which will mount the `~/Documents/Data` directory on your computer to the `/Data` directory within the container.

## HPC
If you're looking to use this container in an HPC environment we recommend using [Singularity-HPC](https://singularity-hpc.readthedocs.io) to use the container just as any other module on the cluster. Check out the SHPC gasnet container [here](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-hpc/r/ghcr.io-autamus-gasnet/).
