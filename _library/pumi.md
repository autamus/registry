## Description
SCOREC RPI's Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure (PUMI). An efficient distributed mesh data structure and methods to support parallel adaptive analysis including general mesh-based operations, such as mesh entity creation/deletion, adjacency and geometric classification, iterators, arbitrary (field) data attachable to mesh entities, efficient communication involving entities duplicated across multiple tasks, migration of mesh entities between tasks, and dynamic load balancing.

## Usage
### Pull (Download)
To download the latest version of pumi run,

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/autamus/pumi:latest
```

or to download a specific version of pumi run,

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/autamus/pumi:2.2.5
```
### Run
To run the container as an application run,
```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/autamus/pumi pumi --version
```

or to run the container in an interactive session run,
```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/autamus/pumi bash
```

### Mounting volumes between the container and your machine
To access files from your machine within the pumi container you'll have to mount them using the `-v external/path:internal/path` option.

For example,
```bash
docker run -v ~/Documents/Data:/Data ghcr.io/autamus/pumi pumi /Data/myData.csv
```
which will mount the `~/Documents/Data` directory on your computer to the `/Data` directory within the container.

## HPC
If you're looking to use this container in an HPC environment we recommend using [Singularity-HPC](https://singularity-hpc.readthedocs.io) to use the container just as any other module on the cluster. Check out the SHPC pumi container [here](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-hpc/r/ghcr.io-autamus-pumi/).
