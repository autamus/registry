This module is a singularity container wrapper for ghcr.io/autamus/ior.
IOR is a parallel IO benchmark that can be used to test the performance of parallel storage systems using various interfaces and access patterns. 
After [installing shpc](#install) you will want to install this container module:

```bash
$ shpc install ghcr.io/autamus/ior
```

Or a specific version:

```bash
$ shpc install ghcr.io/autamus/ior:3.3.0
```

And then you can tell lmod about your modules folder:

```bash
$ module use ./modules
```

And load the module, and ask for help, or similar.

```bash
$ module load ghcr.io/autamus/ior/3.3.0
$ module help ghcr.io/autamus/ior/3.3.0
```

You can use tab for auto-completion of module names or commands that are provided.

### Commands

When you install this module, you'll be able to load it to make the following commands accessible:

#### ghcr.io-autamus-ior-run:

```bash
$ singularity run <container>
```

#### ghcr.io-autamus-ior-shell:

```bash
$ singularity shell -s /bin/bash <container>
```

#### ghcr.io-autamus-ior-exec:

```bash
$ singularity exec -s /bin/bash <container> "$@"
```

#### ghcr.io-autamus-ior-inspect-runscript:

```bash
$ singularity inspect -r <container>
```

#### ghcr.io-autamus-ior-inspect-deffile:

```bash
$ singularity inspect -d <container>
```


#### ior
       
```bash
$ singularity exec <container> /opt/view/bin/ior
```



In the above, the `<container>` directive will reference an actual container provided
by the module, for the version you have chosen to load. Note that although a container
might provide custom commands, every container exposes unique exec, shell, run, and
inspect aliases. For each of the above, you can export:

 - SINGULARITY_OPTS: to define custom options for singularity (e.g., --debug)
 - SINGULARITY_COMMAND_OPTS: to define custom options for the command (e.g., -b)
