This module is a singularity container wrapper for bids/pymvpa.
Take fMRI data and generates ROI based MultiVariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) outputs (https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/PyMVPA)
After [installing shpc](#install) you will want to install this container module:

```bash
$ shpc install bids/pymvpa
```

Or a specific version:

```bash
$ shpc install bids/pymvpa:latest
```

And then you can tell lmod about your modules folder:

```bash
$ module use ./modules
```

And load the module, and ask for help, or similar.

```bash
$ module load bids/pymvpa/latest
$ module help bids/pymvpa/latest
```

You can use tab for auto-completion of module names or commands that are provided.

### Commands

When you install this module, you'll be able to load it to make the following commands accessible:

#### bids-pymvpa-run:

```bash
$ singularity run <container>
```

#### bids-pymvpa-shell:

```bash
$ singularity shell -s /bin/bash <container>
```

#### bids-pymvpa-exec:

```bash
$ singularity exec -s /bin/bash <container> "$@"
```

#### bids-pymvpa-inspect-runscript:

```bash
$ singularity inspect -r <container>
```

#### bids-pymvpa-inspect-deffile:

```bash
$ singularity inspect -d <container>
```



#### bids-pymvpa

```bash
$ singularity run <container>
```


In the above, the `<container>` directive will reference an actual container provided
by the module, for the version you have chosen to load. Note that although a container
might provide custom commands, every container exposes unique exec, shell, run, and
inspect aliases. For each of the above, you can export:

 - SINGULARITY_OPTS: to define custom options for singularity (e.g., --debug)
 - SINGULARITY_COMMAND_OPTS: to define custom options for the command (e.g., -b)
